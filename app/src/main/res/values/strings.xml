    <string name="want_more">More beer?</string>

    <string name="first_string">Sorry, wine!  Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in America; 85% of all alcoholic beverages sold here are beer.  My thought on why it\'s so popular:  It\'s so damn good.</string>
    <string name="second_string">The U.S. consumes 28 gallons of beer per person per year.  That\'s about 299 12-ounce glasses of beer for each of us.  But it\'s not even close to people in the Czech Republic, who knock back about 40 gallons a year!  </string>
    <string name="third_string">Cenosillicaphobia is the fear of having an empty beer glass.  Whether or not you can say it, remember:  The only thing we should fear is fear itself, and of course, that empty glass.</string>
    <string name="fourth_string" formatted="false" translatable="false">The strongest beer in the world happens to be a beer called Snake Venom, raging in at about 67.5% alcohol by volume. In comparison, our beer comes in at a whopping 6%.</string>
    <string name="fifth_string">The most expensive beer in the world is an extremely rare Belgian beer, Vielle Bon Secours, at around $1,000 per 12-liter bottle.  Add airfare to the cost, too, since you can only buy it in London.</string>
